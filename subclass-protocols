SubClasses Vs Protocols
Subclasses:A subclass inherits methods and instance variables from its superclass.A subclass can override a method it inherits from the class it is based on. The class it is based on is called its superclass. If subclassname overrides a method named methodname it inherits from classname but it'd like to use the classname variation on methodname instead of its own, it can do something like:
Protocol:
A protocol is a group of related properties and methods that can be implemented by any class. They are more flexible than a normal class interface, since they let you reuse a single API declaration in completely unrelated classes. This makes it possible to represent horizontal relationships on top of an existing class hierarchy.
Protocol Syntax:
@protocol prot1 <NSObject> or :<NSProtocol>
//methods
@end

Implementation:

//Must import protocol file.
@interface class_name: NSObject <prot1>
{ }
//methods
@end

Subclass Syntax:

@interface sub_class:super_class
//methods
@end
@implementation sub_class
//definition
@end


Protocols are just the rules or properties to be used in the inherited classes to relate two different type of objects. Hence no concept of over riding. A class must implement all methods in a protocol it declares itself as adopting.
A subclass can override a method it inherits from the class it is based on. The class it is based on is called its superclass. Hence inheriting the variables and methods through which super class can be modified. 

For example, you may have a "car" class which has properties that are common to all cars such color, tires, engine, etc. For some reason you need to differentiate between different types of cars but you don't want to repeat all those properties and behaviors in each new class so you write subclasses of the "car" class. So you may have subclasses such as "manual cars", "automatic cars.
But in protocols, A text field class might have a delegate that implements an informal protocol with an optional method for performing auto-completion of user-typed text. The text field discovers whether the delegate implements that method (via reflection) and, if so, calls the delegate's method to support the auto-complete feature.
Protocols have many advantages. The idea is to provide a way for classes to share the same method and property declarations without inheriting them from a common ancestor
